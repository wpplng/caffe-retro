# Exercise Lexicon: Caffe Retro

## Description

You are contacted by the advertising agency **SkissaMera**, who has produced a sketch of a website for a client – a café called **Caffe Retro**.

<figure><img src="assets/screenshot.png" alt="Sketch screenshot of the Caffe Retro website layout"></figure>

## Sketch

The sketch is provided as a video titled **"Caffe Retro sketch"**, showcasing a website divided into three main sections: **Hot**, **Juice**, and **Cozy**. Watch the video carefully — pause and review details as you build the site.

You are expected to **imitate the sketch as closely as possible**.
Do **not** use your own images or fonts. Use only the assets provided in the `assets` folder. The built-in CSS color `darkred` is a suitable main color for this exercise.

## Instructions

- The website must have **three sections**: Hot, Juice, and Cozy.
- Each section should **fill the entire viewport height**.
- Each section should have a **header**, **text content**, and a **background image**, exactly as shown in the sketch.
- The website must contain a **fixed top navigation menu** with links to the three sections.
- All **background images must fully cover** their respective sections.
- Use **semantic HTML elements** wherever possible (e.g. `<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`). Avoid using `<div>` or `<span>` unless necessary for layout or styling.
- The site must be **responsive**: it should adapt to smaller screens using stacking, font resizing, and other techniques shown in the sketch video.
- The site must consider **basic accessibility** principles:

  - Use proper heading levels in order (e.g. `<h1>` followed by `<h2>`, not jumping levels).
  - Ensure all **links use semantic `<a>` tags**, even for internal navigation.
  - All **images must have descriptive `alt` attributes**.
  - Ensure **good contrast** between text and background for readability.
  - Use **web-safe or embedded fonts** from the assets folder to maintain clarity and legibility.

All images, fonts, texts, and the sketch video are available in the **`assets`** folder. Your goal is to create a clean, accessible, and responsive version of the site that closely matches the provided sketch.
